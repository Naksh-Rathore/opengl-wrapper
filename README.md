# GLFW, GLAD, and OpenGL Starter

## Overview

A custom OpenGL wrapper made to help me and others code faster. It uses OOP and modern C++ to have a smooth experience writing OpenGL code for games, simulations, and more!

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo: git clone `https://github.com/Naksh-Rathore/opengl-vscode-starter.git`
2. Change the file paths in the project configs to your own
3. Code something and run it!

The makefile can be used with many files without needing to change, but the library paths do need to be changed only once.
