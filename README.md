# GLFW, GLAD, and OpenGL Starter

## Overview

A simple repo designed to help you get started on OpenGL. It uses Visual Studio Code, Windows 11 and x64-based processor. The file paths are according to my computer, so I recommend changing them to your own.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo: git clone `https://github.com/Naksh-Rathore/opengl-vscode-starter.git`
2. Change the file paths in the project configs to your own
3. Code something and run it!

The makefile can be used with many files without needing to change the makefile, but the library paths do need to be changed.
